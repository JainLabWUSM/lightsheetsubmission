Scripts used for generating data in this paper https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.29.605633 are gathered here under the code tab. 

The central algorithms for this experiment are the nettracers. This code capsule features an early version, NetTracer3D_V1, which was utilized until a more flexible and user-friendly version was developed, NetTracer3D_V2. Note both were utilized at points in this experiment with largely similar outputs due to the params used. See the readme files in each NetTracer3D folder for more information.

The measuring_data folder features more scripts that were utilized for more generalized morphological analysis on the lightsheet images.

The graphs_and_statistics folder has scripts that were used to graph data or run statstical analyses. Note that the stats.py file has a plethora of statistical methods that the user is prompted to choose from when running the script. Not all of which were used for analysis in this paper.

Under data is a selection of largely downsampled data (to fit within code ocean memory limits). Note that analysis in the experiment was often done on images that were a lot less downsampled. Expect generally similar outputs for the 20x networks but other scripts in the measuring_data folder will be altered by the downsampling. Please see the V2 user manual in NetTracer3D_V2 folder for more documentation.

Of the included scripts, the following data corresponds to each:

Script to tabulated data guide (for supplemental tables):
Supplemental Table 3 - From angle_extractor.py
Supplemental Table 4 - From glom_grapher.py
Supplemental Table 5 - From duct_grapher.py
Supplemental Table 6 - From nerve_densities_5x.py
Supplemental Table 7 - From nerve_densities_20x.py
Supplemental Table 9 - From NetTracer3D_V2 package and/or NetTracer3D_V1_20x.py
Supplemental Table 10 - From NetTracer3D_V2 package
Supplemental Table 11 - From nerve_densities_5x.py (for bulk innervation information), convex_3D.py (for density information), counter.py (for counting glomeruli)
Supplemental Table 13 - From NetTracer3D_V2 package and/or NetTracer3D_V1_5x.py
Supplemental Table 14 - From nerve_desnities_2D.py
Supplemental Table 15 - From cell_counter.py
Supplemental Table 18 - From NetTracer3D_V2 package (specifically, morphology.py)

Please utilize the reproducible run function for a set of sample outputs applied in the same way as analyses in the paper were conducted. I would highly recommend reading the main.py file's comments and checking the corresponding print outputs in the console when running main.py, for more information about the methods involved.
